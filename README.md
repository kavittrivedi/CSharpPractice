## What is .NET Core?

.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern applications. It allows developers to create web apps, APIs, microservices, and console applications using languages like C#, F#, and VB.NET. Unlike the older .NET Framework, .NET Core runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it more flexible for different environments.

## What is Middleware?

Have you written any custom middleware? Explain in simple language.

Middleware in the context of web development is a piece of software that sits between the request from a user (client) and the response that your application sends back to the client. It processes the incoming request, modifies it, or performs actions based on it before it reaches the next part of your application or before the response is sent back.

In simple terms, middleware acts like a gatekeeper for your application, doing tasks like:

- **Logging**: Keeping track of requests to monitor how your app is being used.
- **Authentication**: Checking if the user is allowed to access the requested resource.
- **Error handling**: Catching errors in the application before the response is sent to the user.
- **Request modification**: Changing or adding things to the request, like headers or query parameters.

## Custom Middleware

Yes, you can write your own custom middleware. Here's an example of a custom middleware in .NET Core:

```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Add custom logic before the request reaches the controller
        Console.WriteLine("Request received at: " + DateTime.Now);

        // Call the next middleware in the pipeline
        await _next(context);

        // Add custom logic after the response is generated
        Console.WriteLine("Response sent at: " + DateTime.Now);
    }
}
```

## Using Custom Middleware

To use the custom middleware in your application, you need to register it in the Startup.cs file:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();

    // other middlewares like routing, authorization, etc.
}
```

In this example, the CustomMiddleware logs the time when the request is received and when the response is sent. You can extend this middleware to include other tasks as per your requirements.
